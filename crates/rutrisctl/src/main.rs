    // 1. Run game
    // 2. Generate stuff? For sunshine, desktop files, shell scripts? May be that's a separate binary?
    // 3. A watcher that would auto-generate stuff on file change? May be that's a also separate binary with it's own config?
    // 4. rutrisctl? to check latest deps and update them? and to manage games yaml?
