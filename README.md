Brie is a CLI toolset for running Windows games via [Wine] in isolated prefixes, which also
  - Adds units to [Steam] as non-Steam games
  - Creates `.desktop` files
  - Manages [Sunshine] config

Much like [Lutris] and [Heroic Game Launcher], this tool tries to set up an environment closely resembling [Proton] for running games.
Unlike these tools, Brie aims to be CLI-first, with all runnable units and the configuration defined by a user in a single YAML file.

Originally this project started as a [shell script](https://github.com/nikarh/brie/blob/b4e09a0714f15c92a93504be32fba6428bd0dabf/play.sh), which at some point became too inconvenient to maintain and debug.

## Goals

Even though on the surface project shares similarities with [Lutris] and [Heroic Game Launcher], this project has different goals:

  - Designed to be CLI-first
  - The configuration for the runnable units is defined in a single YAML text file
  - Automatically download necessary [wine] distribution, and libraries and create an isolated wine prefix per unit
  - Automatically create `.desktop` files for configured units, as well as add them to [Sunshine] and [Steam] as non-Steam games

## CLI tools

The project provides two CLI tools.

### brie

`brie` is the unit launcher.

- The launcher uses `YAML` manifest, containing definitions of units. Each unit defines the executable that should be run, details about the wine prefix, additional steps (`winetricks`), and library dependencies.
- Before launching the unit, the tool:
  - Downloads optional dependencies with their corresponding versions defined for the unit:
    - [wine-ge-custom](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom)
    - [dxvk](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk)
    - [dxvk-gplasync](https://gitlab.com/Ph42oN/dxvk-gplasync)
    - [dxvk-nvapi](https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi)
    - [vkd3d-proton](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton)
    - [nvidia-libs](https://github.com/SveSop/nvidia-libs) for `nvcuda`, `nvoptix` and `nvml`.
  - Creates a Wine prefix
    - Unlinks symlinks to `~/{Downloads,Documents}` and other folders
    - Ensures file associations are [not propagated to the host](https://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ#How_can_I_prevent_Wine_from_changing_the_filetype_associations_on_my_system_or_adding_unwanted_menu_entries.2Fdesktop_links.3F)
  - Installs downloaded libraries
  - Runs `winetricks`
  - Runs additional preparation scripts
  - Creates symlinks to mount letters provided in the config
- Sets the environment variables and launches the unit in the isolated Wine prefix with the requested runtime. Can optionally run the unit with additional tools if configured (e.g. `gamemoderun` and `mangohud`)

### briectl

`briectl` is responsible for additional features not necessarily related to launching units.

- Download icons and banners from the [SteamGridDB]
- Generate `.desktop` files for units
- Add units to the [Sunshine] configuration file
- Add units to [Steam] as anon-Steam games


## Paths

Brie uses [xdg] to determine where configuration and relevant data are stored.
Most commonly it would be:

 - Configuration in `~/.config/brie/brie.yaml`
 - Application state in `~/.local/share/brie`:
   - Wine prefixes in `~/.local/share/brie/prefixes`
   - Cached wine and libraries in `~/.local/share/brie/libraries`
   - Cached images (banners, icons) in `~/.local/share/brie/images`
